---++Globus Error: 43

---+++Syntax:

=Globus error 43: the job manager failed to stage the executable=

---+++Known cause:

The file may not exist.

---+++Recommendation:

Ensure that the file exists at the specified path.

---+++Known cause:

This can also be a result of file permissions.

---+++Recommendation:

Check file permissions on the specified file.  Change them so that the remote site can access the executable.

---+++Known cause:

Globus cannot find the executable.  Often, this is caused by failed communication between the jobmanager (i.e. condor, pbs) and localhost and can indicate firewall/hostname/internet connectivity issues.

---+++Recommendations:

   * Make certain that $GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE is set.
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% echo $GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE
</pre>

   * $GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE should be set as a persistent env variable in /etc/profile, or exported when you source Globus.  Note: you may need the help of the person in charge of firewalls at your site to choose an appropriate port range.
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=20000,25000
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% echo $GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE 
20000,25000
</pre>

   * Make certain $GLOBUS_HOSTNAME and $HOSTNAME are set correctly.  Note: While $HOSTNAME should be set, you can specify which host to use as opposed to setting $GLOBUS_HOSTNAME

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% export GLOBUS_HOSTNAME=`hostname`
</pre>

   * Remember to check that the client's firewall rules are compatible with Globus' range
   * If you are using condor to submit jobs, make sure to restart it before re-submitting the job.
